# README_generator_Challenge9

## Description

Challenge 9 is to create a readme generator using the command line.

This challenge was quite fun and interesting to do, putting the knowledge of the recent classes about node and what types of things we can do with inquirer to use. It was fairly straight-forward and relatively easier compared to the last couple of assignments we had, which I am not opposed to haha!

One thing I learnt, which is more a comment about how the badges and links are set up, is that many of them have different syntax that would not work with my code for capturing them. To give an example, the Mozilla Public License 2.0 url for the img utilizes MPL_2.0 while the link on opensource.org uses MPL-2.0. I ended up paring down my license choices based on which had the same call signs for both the badge icon and license link instead of having multiple if-else statements to cover them. In the future, if I want to use this for actual READMEs, I will have to go back and fix this.
